# Welcome to my profile!
### *I'll give you a brief introduction to what you'll find here...*
  
  You'll find several repositories, but you might notice a pattern in the names. I'll explain why:
  - ***Repositories started with the word "Estudo":*** I used them to catalog my studies on certain topics and test development concepts.
  
  - ***Repositories started with the word "Projeto":*** I used them to create functional projects on topics and technologies I was using at the time.

  Once you've explained that, feel free to explore and contribute to a project if you'd like!
  
  See ya!
